## Pyber
# Used Python and Matplotlib to visualze Pyber ride sharing data for rural, suburban, and urban areas.

- Built a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

  Average Fare ($) Per City
  Total Number of Rides Per City
  Total Number of Drivers Per City
  City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
