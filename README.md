# Pyber
## Used Python and Matplotlib to visualze Pyber ride sharing data for rural, suburban, and urban city type.

- Built a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
  - Average Fare ($) Per City
  - Total Number of Rides Per City
  - Total Number of Drivers Per City
  - City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

- Produced the following pie charts to breakdown each city type:
  - % of Total Fares by City Type
  - % of Total Rides by City Type
  - % of Total Drivers by City Type
